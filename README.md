# HYPE Kaleidoscope

This repository contains a kaleidoscope implementation for [Processing](https://processing.org/) / [HYPE](www.hypeframework.org/).

I've uploaded the code here in order to show my solution for the kaleidoscope "mandalas" in my workspace at [Skillshare](https://www.skillshare.com/classes/design/Programming-Graphics-I-Introduction-to-Generative-Art/782118657/projects/40423).
The `HKaleidoscope` class is very tailored for the use in this project, and is in its current state not usable for the Hype framework.

The input file located in this repository was taken from unsplash.com

Replace it with other input files - it's really fun to play around with, and you can create amazing images!

I've uploaded a video with a Picasso image to [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUdclHk_Xlw).

Have Fun!
